chapter 9 homework-

after finding the greatest subscript print and delete. use remove
data.remove(greatestsubscript)
counter value associated to ip address for greatest value


Chapter 10-

Class is a custom data type.
slide 3-

super class or parent
subclass or child class

slide 4-
constructor are unqiue because no return type.
constrcutor can have parametters
constrcutors that require parameters will error without inputs

slide5-
Super means go to my parent class and call constructor and provide these two parameters

constrcutors with inheritance need to call something from the super class

@override can be used to override a method that is in a inheritance subclass position

constructor has to be setup for each inheritance

poly morphism ability to take on many forms

you can use super class with an instance of subclass

User(super) test = new Student(subclass)

@override superclass method with subclass method
java will always favor the subclass method
constructors all files have to be present constructors in super always get run first

subclass needs to call constructor first line in super class

slide 11-

Sprite Super Class - Width, height, rotation, picture - in Super Mario it would be an unmoving picture of Mario move() move sprit in its own frame
^
Character going to be more specific sprite - name - dialog, HP, inventory, move() <-- literal x and y movement
^^

 AI Character - method called move()
Player Character - move() - player input

Sprite xyz = new PlayerCharacter;
xyz move();  - bottom most in subclass would be called

slide 12 -

Object class is the most super class

static only one copy of it across your whole program -

Homework PS3 -

Secret messsage into encrytpion cypher - scramble unreadable message - algorythim to scramble
Cipher adds key
decyper message -subtract key
send to another person - dicypher -> secret message

secret message plain text

scrambled message is Ciphertext

Notes 09/13/18
Abstract -
Abstract class means its missing one or more methods in there.
Forces the sublclass to implement those methods.



Shopping Cart
  ^

  | extends shopping cart
Discount Cart  <- Public class DiscountCart extends ShoppingCart{

        public void applySale(){
         subtotal *= 0.9;

}
}
}

Interface - Slide 16
Car      public interface Car not a class but a interface
 ^

Tesla

Dash arrow means interface not a class
in Tesla TurnLeft, TurnRight, accelerate, getSpeed.  (everything is static final public) based around int verison = 5;

interface we will use for call back stuff.

Classes can implement multiple interfaces but extend only one class. <-- test question
